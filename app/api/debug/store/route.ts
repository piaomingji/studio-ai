 * A read-only look at whether the store is actually working.

 * null, which is right for serving traffic and useless for working out why a limit will not stick.
 * This writes one throwaway key, reads it back, and reports what the session resolves to.
 *
 * It reveals nothing sensitive: no connection string, no token, no other account's data -- only
 * whether this deployment can reach its own database, and what it believes about the person asking.
 * Remove it once the limits are confirmed working.
